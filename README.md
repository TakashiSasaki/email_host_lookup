## Development and Testing

To set up the development environment and run tests:

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    Make sure you have Poetry installed. Then, navigate to the project root and run:
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```
    This will install all dependencies, including those required for development and testing.

2.  **Run tests:**
    To execute the test suite, run:
    ```bash
    poetry run pytest
    ```
    This command directly invokes `pytest` using Poetry's script execution capabilities.
